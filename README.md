- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and modular code. It's important to consider not only the immediate task at hand but also the potential for future changes and updates. Remember that code is read more often than it's written, so strive to make it easy to understand and debug. Use meaningful variable names, write clear comments, and follow established coding conventions. Lastly, don't be afraid to refactor your code when necessary to improve its quality and readability."
